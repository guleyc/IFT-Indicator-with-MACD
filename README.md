# IFT Indicator with MACD - Pinescript

The Inverse Fisher Transform (IFISH) was authored by John Ehlers. The IFISH applies some math functions and constants to a weighted moving average (WMA) of the relative strength index (RSI) of the closing price to calculate its oscillator position. The user may change the input (close) and period lengths. This indicatorâ€™s definition is further expressed in the condensed code given in the calculation below.
